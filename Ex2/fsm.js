/* Finite State Machine 
    This machine is specialized so that when it fails to find a match for a state transition
    it will transition to the start state, which is assumed to be 0.  Also, state transition
    rules are tested in the order they are added.  See example string split code.
    This form of class definition was introduced in ECMAScript 2015, i.e version ES6.  Previous
    versions use constructor functions and add methods via prototype functions.  Public and
    private fields are not yet standardized so we don't use them here.
